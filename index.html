        <p class="hero-lead">
          Behind every tap, chip or online checkout, a card network connects your bank and the merchant. This page explains how that network is structured, who gets paid, and why it matters for fees, protections and where your card is accepted.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Card Network?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>card network</strong> is the infrastructure that carries payment messages between the bank that issued your card and the financial institution that serves the merchant. It defines technical standards, routing rules and many of the protections that apply when something goes wrong.</p>
      <p>When people talk about “which network” a card runs on, they usually mean which brand and ruleset sits in the middle of the transaction — not which bank issued the plastic or digital card you hold.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Payment flow -->
    <section id="flow" class="section">
      <h2>How a Card Payment Flows Through the Network</h2>
      <p>Even a simple tap at a terminal involves several steps:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li><strong>1. Authorisation request:</strong> The merchant’s terminal sends a request through their bank or payment provider into the card network.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Routing to issuer:</strong> The network identifies your issuing bank based on the card number and forwards the request.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Approval or decline:</strong> The issuer checks balance, limits, fraud signals and either approves or declines.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Response back to merchant:</strong> The decision is routed back through the network so the terminal can show “approved” or “declined”.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Clearing &amp; settlement:</strong> Later, the transaction is “cleared” and funds move from issuer to acquirer, minus network and interchange fees.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The card network doesn’t usually lend you money directly. Instead, it enforces rules and connects participants so issuers, acquirers and merchants can interact at global scale.</p>

              <td>The scheme that sits in the middle.</td>
              <td>Routes authorisations, defines rules, sets some fee frameworks and protections.</td>
              <td>Affects global acceptance, chargeback rights and sometimes dispute timelines.</td>

        The exact roles and contracts can vary, especially with modern payment aggregators and wallets — but the network remains the backbone that ties them together.
